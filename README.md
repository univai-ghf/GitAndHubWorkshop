Git and Baby Python Preliminaries for Ai1, Fall 2019

1. Students should install [Anaconda Python 3.7 version](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
2. Students on Windows should install [git for windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). This will also give you a new terminal with a `bash` shell (in addition to windows `command.com`), which is the standard command line shell on unix like systems. 

Mac users have git pre-installed. If you are a linux user, we'll assume you know what you are doing and have installed git.

In Anaconda run the Jupyter Lab interface from the Anaconda GUI. Then open `intropython.ipynb` and `git.ipynb` in that interface.

On all OS's open a terminal with bash running. On OSX this is `Terminal.app`, on linux `New Terminal`, and on windows `git-bash` terminal. The git commands in `git.ipynb` are intended to be carried out from this shell.
